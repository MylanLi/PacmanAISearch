# Search algorithms for Pacman AI

## Goals
1. Implement search algorithms

This was for a university assignment in 2022, implementing some basic search algorithms in a Pacman platform, which the subject had adapted from the UC Berkely Pac-Man projects. It required implementing two algorithms, enforced hill climbing and IDA*, followed by creating the heuristic and other aspects of a more complicated scenario. Full specifications of the assignment can be found in the assignment_readme file.

## Technology
1. Python
2. Modified [UC Berkely Pac-Man projects](http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html).
